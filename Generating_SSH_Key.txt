Step 1: Check for SSH keys
First, we need to check for existing SSH keys on your computer. Open up your Terminal and type:
cd ~/.ssh
ls -al
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory
Check the directory listing to see if you have files named either id_rsa.pub or id_dsa.pub. If you don't have either of those files go to step 2. Otherwise, you can skip to step 3.
Step 2: Generate a new SSH key
To generate a new SSH key, copy and paste the text below, making sure to substitute in your email. The default settings are preferred, so when you're asked to "enter a file in which to save the key,"" just press enter to continue.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label
# 
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
# 
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
Next, you'll be asked to enter a passphrase.
Tip: We strongly recommend a very good, secure passphrase. For more information, see Working with SSH key passphrases.
# 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
# 
Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
Which should give you something like this:
# 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
# 
Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
# 
The key fingerprint is:
# 
01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@example.com
Then add your new key to the ssh-agent:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Step 3: Add your SSH key to GitHub
Run the following code to copy the key to your clipboard.
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard
Alternatively, using your favorite text editor, you can open the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file and copy the contents of the file manually
Start  git to connect:
409  git config user.name "PhanVanTrung"
410  git config user.email "vantrungphan2012@gmail.com"

Add file to git
  411  ls
  412  git add ./
Tao 1 remote voi git repository 
  413  git remote add original1 git@bitbucket.org:PhanVanTrung/test.git
  414  git remote -v


Commit to local repository
  415  git commit -m "lan1"
 Before push source code , you should pull source code 
  422  git pull original1 master

Push 
  423  git push original1 master
